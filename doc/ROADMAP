just create a few migrations to hold data from import scraping of controller
*intending to import controller fields as text blobs and made a new model for it
*added currency field to asking price
*changed airport field to location for airframes

I think we should make the broker message on retail spec come  up like a chat in G+ or facebook. It would entice people to respond right there!

I also like the G+ profile image and crop tool. 

next up:
1x    finish importing for controller, aso, tap - make sure to use real headers
1x    finish bookmarklet ui, create import update feature
1.5x  finish retail spec page, allow positioning of images, create carousel
2x    finish airframe show page, add analytics and editable details
1x    integrate payments
2x    marketing and signup brochure site
1x    profile page and misc ui improvements
1x    contact page and actions page
.5x   check all services operational (s3, sendgrid, etc)
